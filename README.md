###Why did I do this to myself...  


This is just fucking dumb. I don't know why I fucking
decided to make this website. I honestly cannot fucking think of a bigger  
waste of my Sunday than to make this. I can't believe that I'm saying this  
but I actually found it fun. I never used HTML/CSS before, and I struggled with
it. So, so fucking much. I used HTML once before, and it was when I was twelve.
I'm fucking 18 years old now. I've been getting bored of Python and running out  
dumb shit to do with it. But with this fucking shit I'm pretty sure that I'll
almost never run out of things to do lmao.


Things I do need to fix are:
 - To make sure that every resolution looks the same, I didn't know how to do
 that.
 - Make a better looking gradient.
 - Make my own shit more, instead of just looking it up, because if I just
 thought about it for 5 fucking minutes I would be fine.
